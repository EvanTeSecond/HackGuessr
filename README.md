right click on the bookmarks bar
select "Show bookmarks bar" so that theres a checkmark next to it
right click the bookmarks bar again
click add page

replace the url with the HackGuessr javascript code
MAKE SURE THE BEGINNING OF THE URL STARTS WITH "javascript:" (you can verify by selecting the url with ctrl + a then clicking the left arrow key)
Choose where you want to save the bookmark (optional)

if you are a student and want to use this at school where javascript bookmarklets and inspecting are blocked, setup uBlobeBM (https://blobby-boi.github.io/uBlobeBM/) but replace *##+js(blob.js) with *##+js(blob.js, set-constant, CSP_POLICY, null) so that it works for more sites. now just run uBlobeBM on WorldGuessr, insert the HackGuessr javascript (pasting the code will remove the javascript: at the front of the code so add javascript: to the front of the code), and run it
