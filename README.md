# HackGuessr - A WorldGuessr Bookmarklet Tool
HackGuessr is a JavaScript bookmarklet designed for WorldGuessr (a free alternative to GeoGuessr). It allows users to easily locate their position on the map in a WorldGuessr game by interacting with a pop-up map while providing helpful controls for zooming, panning, and viewing coordinates.

# What is a Bookmarklet?
A bookmarklet is a bookmark that contains JavaScript code rather than a URL. This allows users to run a script directly from their bookmarks bar, adding useful functionalities to websites like WorldGuessr.
